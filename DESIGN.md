# .principles — System Design

This document describes the full architecture of the `.principles` hierarchy system for contributors and adopters.

---

## 🗺️ 1. Overview

**What it is:** A portable, project-local configuration system that tells AI coding agents which software engineering principles apply to your codebase — similar in spirit to `.gitignore`, but for coding guidance.

**Philosophy:** `.principles` does not teach the AI anything — the AI already knows SOLID, OWASP, DDD, and the rest. It *focuses and triggers* that knowledge: giving the AI context about which principles matter for this codebase, alongside other AI instructions (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`). The AI instructions tell the agent how to behave; `.principles` tells it which engineering lens to apply.

> See [DISCLAIMER.md](DISCLAIMER.md) — this is a proof of concept. Groups are opinionated, gaps exist, and the catalog is not exhaustive.

**Who it is for:**
- **Developers** who want consistent, principle-driven code review and generation across all their projects
- **Teams** who want shared principle sets tailored to their stack (e.g., Spring Boot, React, microservices)
- **Organizations** who want to add company-specific principles alongside the shipped catalog

**How it works:**
1. A catalog of principles lives in `principles/code/` (shipped with this repo)
2. Companies add their own catalogs in `principles/<namespace>/`
3. Projects place `.principles` files in their directories to declare which principles apply
4. The AI resolves a hierarchy of `.principles` files (innermost overrides outermost) and reads the full principle content before coding or reviewing

**Plain-Text-as-Code:** This repo is a **Plain-Text-as-Code** system. Every artefact is plain text in version control — diffable, composable, portable, and natively readable by both humans and AI tools. Principle files are Markdown, group files are YAML, and the catalog is YAML. No binary formats, no generated code, no lock-in.

---

## 📁 2. Catalog Structure

The `principles/` directory is a **namespace container**. Each subdirectory is a namespace with its own catalog.

```

```

### Pre-compiled context files

Each namespace contains two pre-compiled files that consolidate all its principle guidance into a single read per command invocation:

| File | Used by | Contains |
|------|---------|----------|
| `.context-prime.md` | `/prime` Phase 4 | Principle statement, Why it matters, Good practice — for all principles in the namespace |
| `.context-audit.md` | `/audit` Phase 4 | Principle statement, Violations to detect — for all principles in the namespace |

The command reads one file per namespace and filters to only the entries in the final active set. This avoids reading N individual principle files.

### `catalog.yaml` Schema

Each namespace root must have a `catalog.yaml` with a single field:

```yaml
# principles/<namespace>/catalog.yaml
description: "Human-readable description of this namespace"
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `description` | Yes | Human-readable description of the namespace |

The namespace is the directory name. IDs are derived from file paths (see Section 3) — no explicit `namespace` or `id-prefix` fields are needed. The system discovers all `principles/*/catalog.yaml` files automatically.

---

## 🔑 3. ID Derivation

IDs are **derived from file path** — no separate ID field is needed in the file itself.

### Algorithm

1. Take the path **relative to `principles/`**
2. Split by `/`, drop `.md` extension from the last segment
3. Each **directory** segment → uppercased ID part
4. **Filename** → strip the `<parent-dir-name>-` prefix (case-insensitive), use the remainder as the final ID part
5. Join all parts with `-`

### Examples

| File path (relative to `principles/`) | ID                               |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `solid/srp.md`                        | `SOLID-SRP`                      |
| `gof/strategy.md`                     | `GOF-STRATEGY`                   |
| `ddd/aggregate.md`                    | `DDD-AGGREGATE`                  |
| `code-smells/feature-envy.md`         | `CODE-SMELLS-FEATURE-ENVY`       |
| `grasp/low-coupling.md`               | `GRASP-LOW-COUPLING`             |
| `12factor/01-codebase.md`             | `12FACTOR-01-CODEBASE`           |
| `owasp/01-broken-access-control.md`   | `OWASP-01-BROKEN-ACCESS-CONTROL` |
| `code/api/standard-http-methods.md`   | `CODE-API-STANDARD-HTTP-METHODS` |
| `code/sec/validate-input.md`          | `CODE-SEC-VALIDATE-INPUT`        |
| `corp/corp-0001.md`                   | `CORP-0001`                      |
| `arch/xx/yy/yy-01.md`                 | `ARCH-XX-YY-01`                  |

### Step-by-step: `code/api/standard-http-methods.md`

1. Segments: `code`, `api`, `standard-http-methods`
2. Dir segments uppercased: `CODE`, `API`
3. Filename `standard-http-methods` → does not start with `api-`, use verbatim: `STANDARD-HTTP-METHODS`
4. Join: `CODE-API-STANDARD-HTTP-METHODS`

### Step-by-step: `arch/xx/yy/yy-01.md`

1. Segments: `arch`, `xx`, `yy`, `yy-01`
2. Dir segments: `ARCH`, `XX`, `YY`
3. Filename `yy-01` → strip `yy-` prefix → `01`
4. Join: `ARCH-XX-YY-01`

## 📄 4. Principle File Schema

Every principle file follows this template:

````markdown
# [ID]: [Title]

**Layer**: [1 | 2 | 3]
**Categories**: [comma-separated]
**Applies-to**: [all | comma-separated — languages, platforms, domains, or contexts]

## Principle

[Clear, authoritative statement of the principle in 1-3 sentences.]

## Why it matters

[Explanation of the consequences of ignoring this principle — bugs, maintenance debt, security risks, etc.]

## Violations to detect

- [Specific code pattern that violates this principle]
- [Another violation pattern]

## Good practice

```[language]
// Example showing correct application
```

## Sources

- [Author, *Title*, Publisher, Year. ISBN/DOI/URL]
````

### Fields

| Field                  | Description                                                                |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Layer`                | 1 = always active, 2 = context-dependent, 3 = risk-elevated                |
| `Categories`           | Semantic tags for detection (e.g., `api-design`, `security`, `testing`)    |
| `Applies-to`           | `all` or specific languages, platforms, domains, or architectural contexts |
| `Violations to detect` | Concrete patterns for AI to look for during review                         |
| `Good practice`        | Positive example (AI uses this for generation guidance)                    |
| `Sources`              | At least one verifiable published source                                   |

**Diagrams:** Include a `mermaid` code block in the *Good practice* section whenever the concept has a structural form (class hierarchies, relationships, flows). Mermaid adds machine-readable semantics. If you can draw it, draw it.

## 🗂️ 5. Groups

Groups bundle related principles under a reusable name. They enable one-line activation of a full principle set for a technology.

### Group File Schema (`groups/<name>.yaml`)

```yaml
name: spring-boot
description: "Spring Boot REST APIs and dependency injection"

includes:
  - java              # resolved from groups/java.yaml

principles:
  - CODE-API-011
  - CODE-API-012
  - CODE-SEC-002
  - CODE-AR-003
```

| Field         | Description                                         |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `name`        | Must match filename (without `.yaml`)               |
| `description` | Human-readable summary                              |
| `includes`    | Other group names to compose (resolved recursively) |
| `principles`  | List of principle IDs this group activates          |

### Composition

`includes` is resolved recursively. `spring-data-jpa` includes `spring-boot`, which includes `java` — the result is the full union of all three groups' principles.

**Cycle detection:** The system detects cycles in `includes` chains and raises an error rather than looping infinitely.

### Shipped Groups

| Group              | Includes         | Purpose                                         |

### Rules

- Groups are **additive only** — no exclusions inside groups
- Exclusion is a per-project human decision in `.principles` files
- Groups ship in `groups/` at repo root

---

## 📝 6. `.principles` File Format

Plain text. One entry per line. Filesystem mtime is the implicit last-modified timestamp.

### Syntax

```
# This is a comment (ignored)

# Groups — prefixed with @
@spring-boot
@company-arch

# Bare IDs — direct includes
CODE-OB-004
CORP-0001

# Exclusions — suppresses even if a group activates it
!CODE-API-012
!CODE-TS-001
```

| Syntax     | Meaning                                                                         |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `# ...`    | Comment (ignored)                                                               |
| `@name`    | Include all principles from `groups/name.yaml` (recursive)                      |
| `ID`       | Include a specific principle by ID                                              |
| `!ID`      | Exclude a principle (takes final precedence over everything, including Layer 1) |
| blank line | Ignored                                                                         |

IDs are matched case-insensitively.

### Hierarchy Walk Algorithm

Walk **up** from the file or directory being reviewed to the git repo root (detected by `.git/` presence) or a maximum of 10 levels.

Collect all `.principles` files encountered, ordered **root → target** (outermost first, innermost last).

**Resolution:**

1. `active = { Layer 1 universals }` — always seeded
2. For each `.principles` file (root → target):
   - Expand each `@group` recursively → union into active
   - Union bare IDs into active
   - Union `!ID` into exclusion set
3. `final = active MINUS exclusions`
4. Read full content of each ID's `.md` file from its catalog

**Key properties:**
- Inner `.principles` files extend (not replace) outer ones
- `!ID` exclusions suppress even Layer 1 principles
- The algorithm terminates at the git root, not the filesystem root

### Example Hierarchy

```
/repo-root/
  .principles          ← root file: @spring-boot
  src/
    .principles        ← adds CODE-OB-004, !CODE-API-012
    payments/
      .principles      ← adds @security-focused
```

When reviewing `/repo-root/src/payments/PaymentService.java`:
1. Seed with Layer 1 universals
2. Apply `/repo-root/.principles` → expand `@spring-boot` (→ includes `java`)
3. Apply `/repo-root/src/.principles` → add `CODE-OB-004`, mark `CODE-API-012` excluded
4. Apply `/repo-root/src/payments/.principles` → expand `@security-focused`
5. Subtract exclusion set: remove `CODE-API-012`

## 🛠️ 7. Commands

### ⚡ `/prime`

Activates principles before writing code. Run it before starting work on a task.

**Phases:**

| Phase | Name                          | Description                                                                                    |
|-------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Scan Context                  | Examines the coding context: language, framework, domain, risk signals                         |
| 2     | Resolve .principles Hierarchy | Walks to git root, expands groups, builds active ID set                                        |
| 3     | Dynamic Detection (fallback)  | Only runs if Phase 2 found no `.principles` files; uses signal-based detection                 |
| 4     | Load Principle Content        | Reads one `.context-prime.md` per namespace (pre-compiled); filters to active IDs              |
| 5     | Output                        | Presents active principles table with source column; states coding frame                       |

### 🔎 `/audit`

Reviews code against activated principles. Outputs findings grouped by severity.

**Phases:**

| Phase | Name                          | Description                                                                                    |
|-------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Resolve Input                 | Determines what code to review (file, directory, inline)                                       |
| 2     | Resolve .principles Hierarchy | Same walk algorithm as prime                                                                   |

| 4     | Load Principle Content        | Reads one `.context-audit.md` per namespace (pre-compiled); filters to active IDs             |
| 5     | Review                        | Applies each principle; groups findings by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)                 |
| 6     | Output                        | Compact text report + `audit-output.json` written to repo root; reports principle source       |

### 🔍 `/scout`

## 📦 8. Installer Targets

`install.sh` deploys the three commands (`/scout`, `/prime`, `/audit`) to three AI tool families. Each target writes different files because each tool family has its own discovery mechanism.

**Prerequisites:** Bash 4+. See [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md). On Windows, use `install.ps1` (PowerShell) or `install.cmd` (CMD) — thin wrappers that detect bash and forward all arguments to `install.sh`. See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for platform-specific instructions.

Every target supports two scopes — **global** (no directory argument) applies across all projects, **local** (with a directory argument) applies to a single project:

| Command | Scope | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `./install.sh claude` | Global | `~/.claude/commands/` |
| `./install.sh claude <dir>` | Local | `<dir>/.claude/commands/` |
| `./install.sh copilot` | Global | `~/.copilot/copilot-instructions.md` |
| `./install.sh copilot <dir>` | Local | `<dir>/.github/` |
| `./install.sh cursor` | — | Not supported (see below) |
| `./install.sh cursor <dir>` | Local | `<dir>/.cursor/rules/code-principles.mdc` |
| `./install.sh all` | Global | Claude + Copilot globally; Cursor message |
| `./install.sh all <dir>` | Local | All three tools in `<dir>` |
| `./install.sh --list` | — | Reports what is currently installed globally |

### 🤖 Claude Code (`./install.sh claude [dir]`)

Copies `targets/claude-code/*.md` to the commands directory.

Claude Code discovers slash commands by scanning `~/.claude/commands/` (global) or `<dir>/.claude/commands/` (local) for `.md` files. The file body is the full prompt. No frontmatter is required.

### 🐙 GitHub Copilot (`./install.sh copilot [dir]`)

**Global** (`copilot` with no argument): writes `~/.copilot/copilot-instructions.md` with the Layer 1–3 principle summary. This is consumed by all Copilot clients as always-on background context.

**Local** (`copilot <dir>`): writes three sets of files:

| File | Location | Consumed by |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `copilot-instructions.md` | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | All Copilot clients (always-on context) |
| `SKILL.md` | `.github/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | **Copilot CLI** (terminal slash commands) |
| `<name>.prompt.md` | `.github/prompts/<name>.prompt.md` | **VS Code / JetBrains / Visual Studio** (IDE chat) |

**Skills** (`.github/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) are the CLI mechanism. The Copilot CLI scans `.github/skills/` at startup, reads each `SKILL.md`, and exposes the skill as a `/skill-name` slash command. Skills require a YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`; the `description` is also used by Copilot to decide when to invoke the skill automatically.

**Prompt files** (`.github/prompts/<name>.prompt.md`) are the IDE mechanism. Copilot Chat in VS Code, JetBrains, and Visual Studio discovers `.prompt.md` files in `.github/prompts/` and exposes them as slash commands in the chat panel. They require at minimum a `description:` field in YAML frontmatter.

### 🖱️ Cursor (`./install.sh cursor <dir>`)

Writes to `<dir>/.cursor/rules/code-principles.mdc`.

Cursor discovers rules by scanning `.cursor/rules/` for `.mdc` files. The frontmatter `alwaysApply: true` makes the rule active in all contexts.

**Cursor limitation:** Cursor has no file-based user-level config. Global principles require manual setup via **Cursor → Settings → General → Rules for AI**.

### 🗑️ Uninstall (`./uninstall.sh [dir]`)

Removes the assets written by `install.sh`. Without an argument, removes global assets. With a directory argument, removes local assets from that project. On Windows, use `uninstall.ps1` or `uninstall.cmd`.

## ➕ 9. Adding a New Namespace

To add a company-specific namespace alongside the shipped `code` catalog:

1. **Create the namespace directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p principles/corp
   ```

2. **Create `principles/corp/catalog.yaml`:**
   ```yaml
   description: "Acme Corp engineering standards"
   ```

3. **Add principle files** following the file schema (Section 4):
   ```
   principles/corp/corp-0001.md    → CORP-0001
   principles/corp/infra/infra-001.md → CORP-INFRA-001
   ```

4. **Reference in `.principles` files:**
   ```
   CORP-0001
   CORP-INFRA-001
   ```

The system discovers all `principles/*/catalog.yaml` files automatically. The namespace is the directory name and IDs are derived from file paths.

## 🏷️ 10. ID Format Guidance

### Naming Conventions

- Namespace prefix: uppercase, short (2-6 chars) — `CODE`, `CORP`, `ARCH`
- Category segment: 2-4 uppercase chars — `SD`, `API`, `SEC`, `AR`
- Named files: the full filename is used verbatim as the final ID segment (e.g., `solid/srp.md` → `SOLID-SRP`, `code/api/standard-http-methods.md` → `CODE-API-STANDARD-HTTP-METHODS`, `owasp/01-broken-access-control.md` → `OWASP-01-BROKEN-ACCESS-CONTROL`). Numeric prefixes work the same way (e.g., `12factor/01-codebase.md` → `12FACTOR-01-CODEBASE`).
- Prefer descriptive slugs to opaque numbers — `validate-input.md` is immediately clear; `sec-001.md` is not.
- Avoid: special characters, spaces, mixed case

### Depth Recommendations

| Depth                  | Use when                            | Example              |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------|
| 2 levels: `NS/CAT`     | ≤20 principles per category         | `CODE-SD-001`        |
| 3 levels: `NS/CAT/SUB` | Large category needing sub-grouping | `ARCH-CLOUD-K8S-001` |

Keep paths shallow. Deep nesting makes IDs hard to read and reference.

### When to Add a New Category

Add a new category directory when:
- The topic is distinct enough to warrant its own group (e.g., `security`, `testing`)
- You have at least 3 principles in the category
- Existing categories don't fit well

## 🤝 11. Contributing Principles

> **Scope of this repo:** Principles contributed here must be **established, widely recognized concepts** from the software engineering literature — named principles, published patterns, or documented practices backed by authoritative sources. They must not duplicate what is already in the catalog.
>
> 🍴 If your principle is original, company-specific, domain-niche, or doesn't have an authoritative published source, **fork this repo** and add it in your own namespace (e.g., `principles/corp/`) rather than submitting a PR.

### ✅ Requirements

Every new principle must have:
- A clear principle description in your own words
- At least one verifiable published source (book with ISBN, paper with DOI, or authoritative URL)
- Correct layer assignment (1 = universal, 2 = contextual, 3 = risk-elevated)
- At least one "Violations to detect" entry
- No significant overlap with an existing principle in the catalog

### 🔁 Process

1. Copy `principles/code/TEMPLATE.md` to the appropriate category directory
2. Fill in all fields
3. Derive the ID from the file path (Section 3)
4. Add the principle to relevant groups in `groups/`
5. Submit a pull request with:
   - The principle file
   - Group file updates
   - A brief rationale for the source choice

### 📚 Source Requirements

Acceptable sources:
- Books: full citation with ISBN (e.g., *Effective Java* by Bloch, 3rd ed., ISBN 978-0134685991)
- Papers: DOI or stable URL
- Authoritative specifications: RFC, OWASP, IEEE standard with URL

Not acceptable:
- Blog posts without named authors
- Stack Overflow answers
- Undated sources
