# GRASP-INDIRECTION — Indirection

**Layer:** 2 (contextual)
**Categories:** software-design, coupling-reduction, architecture
**Applies-to:** all

## Principle

Assign responsibility to an intermediate object to mediate between two components in order to avoid direct coupling between them. The intermediary decouples the components so each can vary independently.

## Why it matters

Direct coupling between two components means a change in either forces a change in the other. An intermediary — adapter, broker, facade, or message channel — absorbs the variation and allows each side to evolve without affecting the other.

## Violations to detect

- Two high-level modules directly importing each other's concrete types
- A component knowing the full interface of a remote service rather than talking through a client abstraction
- UI components directly querying databases or calling infrastructure services
- Cross-layer dependencies bypassing the intended architectural boundary

## Good practice

- Introduce an adapter to decouple your code from a third-party library's API
- Use a message broker or event bus to decouple publishers from subscribers
- Apply a facade to hide a complex subsystem behind a simple interface
- Use a repository to decouple domain logic from the persistence mechanism
