# GRASP-HIGH-COHESION — High Cohesion

**Layer:** 1 (universal)
**Categories:** software-design, maintainability
**Applies-to:** all

## Principle

Assign responsibilities so that cohesion remains high. A class should have a small, focused set of closely related responsibilities. Everything in the class should be related to its central purpose.

## Why it matters

Low-cohesion classes — those that do many unrelated things — are hard to understand, hard to reuse, and fragile to change. They accumulate unrelated dependencies, grow without bound, and make testing difficult because every test must set up an ever-wider context.

## Violations to detect

- A class with many methods that span multiple unrelated concerns (a "God class")
- Methods in a class that use completely different sets of fields — a sign the class should be split
- A class that is frequently changed for multiple unrelated reasons
- Utility or "helper" classes that accumulate unrelated static methods over time
- A service class with methods that have nothing to do with each other

## Good practice

- Each class should be describable in one sentence focused on a single theme
- Methods within a class should mostly use the same fields — high method-field cohesion
- When a class grows large, look for responsibility clusters that can be extracted
- Prefer many small, focused classes over a few large, general-purpose ones
