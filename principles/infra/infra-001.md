# INFRA-001 — All infrastructure is code; nothing is configured manually

**Layer:** 1 (universal)
**Categories:** infrastructure, devops, repeatability
**Applies-to:** all

## Principle

Every infrastructure resource — servers, networks, load balancers, IAM roles, DNS records, monitoring rules — must be declared in version-controlled code and applied through an automated pipeline. No human should ever log into a production system and make a configuration change directly. If a change cannot be expressed as code, the tooling or process must be fixed until it can.

## Why it matters

Manual changes are invisible, unrepeatable, and unauditable. A server configured by hand cannot be reliably recreated after failure. A firewall rule added through a console disappears from version history. Over time, environments drift apart — what works in staging stops working in production not because of application bugs but because of invisible infrastructure differences. Infrastructure-as-code eliminates drift by making the desired state explicit and enforceable.

## Violations to detect

- Infrastructure resources that exist in cloud consoles but have no corresponding code definition
- Configuration changes applied via SSH, cloud console UI, or CLI outside of a pipeline
- Environment-specific settings hardcoded in code rather than injected via configuration
- No mechanism to detect or alert on configuration drift between declared and actual state
- "Snowflake" servers that cannot be terminated and recreated without data loss or service impact

## Good practice

- Use a declarative IaC tool (Terraform, Pulumi, AWS CDK, CloudFormation) for all resource definitions
- Apply changes exclusively through a CI/CD pipeline with plan/preview before apply
- Run drift detection on a schedule and alert when actual state diverges from declared state
- Store all environment configuration in version control alongside the infrastructure code
