# ARCH-002 — Design for replaceability, not permanence

**Layer:** 2 (contextual)
**Categories:** architecture, evolutionary-architecture, maintainability
**Applies-to:** all

## Principle

Treat every architectural component — services, databases, frameworks, messaging systems — as replaceable rather than permanent. Design boundaries and interfaces so that any component can be swapped out without requiring changes to adjacent components. Prefer fitness functions over big-bang migration: define measurable criteria that continuously verify the architecture remains aligned with its goals.

## Why it matters

Technology evolves. A framework chosen in 2018 may be a liability in 2025. Teams that treated their choices as permanent investments find themselves locked in by coupling; teams that treated them as current best options find replacement straightforward. Replaceability also forces the discipline of clear interfaces, which independently improves testability and comprehension.

## Violations to detect

- Business logic that imports framework types directly rather than through an abstraction layer
- Service-to-service calls that use a vendor SDK rather than an interface that could be swapped
- Database schema types (e.g. PostgreSQL-specific arrays, MongoDB documents) leaking into domain models
- No agreed fitness function or architectural test suite that would alert the team when boundaries erode

## Good practice

- Define an anti-corruption layer at every external boundary (framework, database, third-party API)
- Write architectural fitness functions — automated tests that assert structural invariants (e.g. ArchUnit, Dependency Cruiser)
- Evaluate components on a replacement timeline, not a permanence assumption
- Document what would need to change if the component were replaced — short lists indicate good boundaries
