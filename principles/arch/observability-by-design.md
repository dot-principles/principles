# ARCH-OBSERVABILITY-BY-DESIGN — Observability is an architectural property, not an afterthought

## Principle

Observability is an architectural property, not an operational afterthought. Every system must be designed from the outset to expose its internal state through structured logs, metrics, and distributed traces. A system that cannot be interrogated during an incident — without deploying new code — is not production-ready.

## Why it matters

In distributed systems, you cannot attach a debugger or observe execution directly. The only window into what a system is doing is the telemetry it emits. Systems not designed for observability force engineers to infer internal state from external symptoms, leading to longer incident resolution times, incorrect root-cause diagnoses, and heightened deployment risk. Observability designed in from the start is an order of magnitude cheaper than observability retrofitted onto a running system under pressure.

## Violations to detect

- Services with no structured logging — only unstructured strings with no extractable, queryable fields
- No correlation IDs propagated across service boundaries, making distributed traces impossible to reconstruct
- Metrics that describe only infrastructure (CPU, memory) with no service-level indicators (request rate, error rate, latency percentiles)
- No defined SLIs or SLOs — the team cannot state in measurable terms what "working correctly" means
- Alerting based solely on static thresholds rather than SLO error-budget burn rates

## Good practice

- Design services to emit structured logs (JSON), metrics (counters, histograms, gauges), and traces (spans with parent IDs) from day one
- Propagate trace context (W3C TraceContext or OpenTelemetry) across all service boundaries — HTTP headers, message metadata, gRPC metadata
- Define SLIs and SLOs before writing the first line of production code; build dashboards from them
- Ensure every outbound call emits a span; every inbound request is tagged with a correlation ID
- Adopt OpenTelemetry as the instrumentation standard to preserve optionality over backend tooling
